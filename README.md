Personalized Student Recommendations
This project analyzes student quiz performance across multiple quizzes and provides personalized recommendations for improvement. The analysis identifies weak areas, tracks progress over time, and suggests steps for better preparation. It uses historical and current quiz data to generate insights on topics like accuracy, strengths, and weaknesses, and visualizes trends in performance over time.

Features
Performance Analysis by Topics: Analyze student performance across different quiz topics (e.g., Math, Science).
Personalized Insights and Recommendations: Based on quiz results, generate actionable insights to improve student performance.
Trend Visualization: Visualize score trends over time to track progress and identify areas for improvement.
Data Aggregation: Combine current quiz data with historical performance to provide a comprehensive analysis.
Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language for analysis.
pandas: For handling and processing data.
matplotlib: For visualizing trends and scores.
JSON: For reading quiz data (current and historical quiz submissions).
Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries:
pandas
matplotlib
JSON-formatted quiz data:
Current quiz data (exam.json)
Current quiz submission data (exam_sub.json)
Historical quiz data (sol.json)
You can install the required libraries using:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas matplotlib
How It Works
Load the Data: The script loads data from three JSON files: current quiz data (exam.json), current quiz submission data (exam_sub.json), and historical quiz data (sol.json).
Analyze Performance: It processes each quiz, computes the average score, accuracy, and the number of correct and incorrect answers for each topic.
Generate Insights: Based on the analysis, the script generates insights for each topic, indicating strengths, weaknesses, and recommending areas to focus on for improvement.
Visualize Trends: It plots a graph showing how the student's performance (score) has changed over time.
Running the Script
Set Up Your Data Files:

Make sure the three JSON files (exam.json, exam_sub.json, and sol.json) are available in your local machine.
Update the paths in the script to point to the correct locations of these files.
Execute the Script:

After ensuring the data files are correctly loaded, run the main.py script using Python:
bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
View the Results:

The script will output the personalized recommendations and insights for each topic.
It will also generate a graph (score_trends.png) showing the score trends over time.
Example Output
For example, the output in the console could look like:

yaml

--- Personalized Insights and Recommendations ---

Topic: Math
  Weakness: 1
  Strength: 2
  Average Accuracy: 80.00%
  Recommendation: Focus on improving accuracy in Math.

Topic: Science
  Weakness: 1
  Strength: 2
  Average Accuracy: 75.00%
  Recommendation: Focus on improving accuracy in Science.
The script will also save a graph score_trends.png that visualizes the score trend over time.

Recommendations
For Students: Focus on improving the areas where youâ€™re consistently scoring low, as suggested in the recommendations.
For Educators: Use these insights to tailor quizzes and educational content that can help students improve in their weak areas.

How to Demonstrate This Script:
Install Required Libraries: Make sure you have pandas and matplotlib installed by running pip install pandas matplotlib.
Prepare Data Files: Place the required exam.json, exam_sub.json, and sol.json files in the project directory.
Run the Script: Execute the script by running python main.py.
View Insights and Trends: The console will print personalized insights, and you will see the trends graph (saved as score_trends.png).
